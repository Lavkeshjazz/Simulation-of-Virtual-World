# Simulation-of-Virtual-World

This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a complete virtual world simulation from scratch. The project's main goal is to establish a dynamic environment that allows self-driving automobiles to travel about freely.

Important characteristics:

Spatial Graphs: To make the virtual environment easy to navigate, the project makes use of spatial graphs to develop an intuitive user interface.

Dynamic Environment: The environment is made up of many components that are created using complicated geometry, including trees, buildings, and road borders.

Integration of Real-World Data: To facilitate city-based simulations, the project incorporates real-world data from OpenStreetMap.

Minimap for Navigation: To make navigating through large, open worlds easier, a minimap is incorporated.
